This project was made to show my learnings this semester. I decided to do a time travel activity in which you go trough different times and play different games accordingly. The first game is a puzzle for three different ancient civilizations. The first one is the easy level, the second one the medium level, and the third one, the hard level. After you choose, and pass the level, you go to the memory card game which is based on the Roaring 20's. Here you learn about the main symbols from the time. After you solve the memory game, you go into your last stop for the time travel which is space/future. Here you have to save some aliens and take them home with you while avoiding the asteroids. After saving 15 aliens, you successfully completed the quest and earn 3 different badges for the three games you played.
